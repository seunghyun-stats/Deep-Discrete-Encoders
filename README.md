# Deep-Discrete-Encoders

This repository contains the MATLAB codes for the manuscript "Deep Discrete Encoders: Identifiable Deep Generative
Models for Rich Data with Discrete Latent Layers"

### For simulations:
The folder `main algorithms` contains the codes for Algorithms 1-3 (basic PEM, double-SVD initialization, penalized SAEM) proposed in the manuscript. Each sub-folder (Bernoulli, Poisson, Normal) corresponds to each observed-layer parametric family.

### For real data analysis:
TBA.

### Additional codes:
The folder `utilities` contains sub-functions that will be required to implement the main algorithms. We recommend adding this folder using the `addpath 'utilities'` command in MATLAB.
