# Deep-Genarative-Model

This repository contains the MATLAB codes for the manuscript "Deep Discrete Encoders: Identifiable Deep Generative
Models for Rich Data with Discrete Latent Layers"



The folder `utilities` contains sub-functions that will be required to implement the main algorithms. We recommend adding this folder using the `addpath 'utilities'` command in MATLAB.
